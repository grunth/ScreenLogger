Screen popper.
One of my old projects in Java for Windows. It often happens that at a new job somebody
explained something to you and you want to keep what is happening on the screen in order 
to restore your knowledge later or write instructions for yourself. I did not find a 
convenient program for this, and recording video from the screen for these purposes 
is too problematic. To solve this problem, I wrote this small and very smart program. 
It does not take up memory, works instantly and does not annoy with unnecessary settings.
It will be useful for programmers, technical support workers, everyone who needs to 
quickly delve into new functionality for themselves and possibly for some other tasks.
